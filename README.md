# Stock-Dashboard

A stock dashboard to search the current price of the stock, get the price history of the last 30 days as well as fetch the top gainers and losers on the NSE. Eventually plan to connect it to my stock price prediction model.

Made using Create React App, material-ui and flask.

Here is a report created about this project that takes you through the workflow, motivations and methodology of the project in brief along with photos of the Dashboard. I'm adding this here since it's a bit diifcult to navigate the code and I haven't added any pictures to help look at what the dashboard is like.
